                I made this site over the course of a couple of weeks after I realized that all of my DnD
                music is spread out over several playlists and multiple platforms. So, rather than scrambling
                to find everything, I figured it would be neat to have a place that is platform-agnostic and
                I can add tags to it so it is easier to search and sort. I am not a designer so pardon the
                aesthetic. Oh and you can also view songs other people have shared as well!
